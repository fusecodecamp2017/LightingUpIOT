# LightingUpIOT

Welcome to lighting up the world with IoT. The following steps should walk you through our day today and what we hope to accomplish:

1. Bluetooth Hacking - To start with we are going to do a bit of hacking bluetooth. You'll learn what you need in order to make devices do what you want! More details about this are in the "bluetooth" folder readme.

2. Bluetooth Programming - Now that we did a bit of hacking its time to actually program bluetooth into the raspberry pi. I find its best to do this in an interactive way so you can really test things out. I have an example, but just have some fun with it!

3. IoT Time - Lets actually hook that program you wrote up to the AWS IoT cloud. Remember, we want this to actually work on the internet!

4. Putting it Together - Its time now to put together IoT and the Bluetooth that we just wrote.

5. Phone app - lets build a phone app that can tell where we are. You can follow instructions in the "app" folder for this.

6. Final touches and recap - put the code we built in step 4 into the phone app and add any cool finishing touches we want. Fun!
